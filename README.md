# Playwright + Currents + playwright-bdd (Cucumber)

This repository showcases running [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) + [Currents](https://currents.dev) + [playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd) to run BDD tests, while using [Currents](https://currents.dev) as the reporting dashboard.

## Why?

`cucumber-js` is a mature and popular test runner, however, it is different from the native Playwright test runner - those are not compatible. To utilize the native Playwright test runner with BDD it is suggested to use [playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd).

## Documentation

The repo contains a few BDD tests with one test that always fails (intentionally):

- [features/homepage.feature](features/homepage.feature) - has intentionally failing test
- [features/todopage.feature](features/todopage.feature)

- Create an organization, get your **Record Key** and **Project Id** at https://app.currents.dev

- Clone repo
- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Install browsers

  ```sh

The results are being reported to Currents for more efficient troubleshooting, and monitoring test suite flakiness and performance.

Currents will collect the following information:

- console output
- screenshots
- videos
- trace files
- timing
- outcomes
- flaky tests
- error details
- tags for more convenient management of the tests
